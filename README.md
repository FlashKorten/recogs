recogs
======

Haskell/SDL based image-recognition-game for people suffering from dementia

## External dependencies:
 - libsdl
 - libsdl-image
 - libsdl-gfx

## How to start
 - `recogs --help` shows command line parameters
 - the file recogs.cnf contains every configuration parameter

## How to play
 - `n` => start with the next image
 - `Space` => show one more tip
 - `Backspace` => hide the last tip
 - `Enter` => reveal the whole image
 - `m` => reshuffle the revealed positions
 - `Escape` = quit the game

## Next steps:
  - Harden against missing files (maybe cleanup of imagelist...)
  - Clean up code... a little more!
  - learn something along the way ;o)
  - find a nice way to show a 'help' screen in game
    explaining how to play (keybindings)

Thanks to the nice and well written comments on reddit to improve this!
