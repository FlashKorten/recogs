Haskell/SDL based image-recognition-game for people suffering from dementia

Next steps:
  - Harden against missing files (maybe cleanup of imagelist...)
  - Clean up code... a little more!
  - learn something along the way ;o)
  - find a nice way to show a 'help' screen in game
    explaining how to play (keybindings)

Thanks to the nice and well written comments on reddit to improve this!
