Haskell/OpenGL based image-recognition-game for people suffering from dementia

Next steps:
  - mapping a texture onto the background: The examples of the GLUT-package seem helpful
  - reading .jpg-images
  - reading a .conf-file specifying the number of segments to use (rows and columns), explicit imagefiles and/or a directory where the images to be used are to be found.
  - parsing command line arguments: segments (like "-s 4x3"), imagefile/directory (like "-i file.jpg" or "-i ~/Pictures/Foo") 
  - learn something along the way ;o)
